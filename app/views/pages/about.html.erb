      Here at Shook Hills All Natural Beef, I have taken these high producing, muscled and marbled cows and crossed them with a large framed, high marbling registered Angus bulls. the final product is a calf that is raised by a mama with rich hardy butterfat milk and great muscling and a herd sire bull with a background of producing grade A beef, large tender steaks, and with tremendous marbling and tenderness. A final product of home raised beef that is second to none. I have a limited supply only of these outstanding beef from year to year. I am very choosy about this tears that I pick out to feed. please feel free to <%= link_to "call and talk to me", contact_path %> personally about any questions or comments that you may have or to place an order.</p>

    The majority of U.S. consumers are not aware that the meat they often consume has been raised with antibiotics in its feed.  Few are aware of the scientific dialogues linking the consumption of such meat with the development of antibiotic resistance in humans.
